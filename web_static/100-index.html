                <p>Palais el Mokri is an amazing place and we were so lucky to meet Zineb's mother, Aziza, who helped us in so many ways. Their riad is magnificent and she explained its history and showed us around. She gave great recommendations for nearby eating and shopping, and she even cooked a fabulous dinner for us one night. The breakfast each morning was delicious, served in the expansive, beautiful courtyard. Aziza made our stay so memorable and went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met. We highly recommend staying at Palais el Mokri if you want an unforgettable experience! Thank you for everything!</p>

                <p>Really nice place and really fun to stay for 3-4 couples or larger family who wants a beautiful house with a nice pool and close to the beaches. The little town Scopello is really nice and a just short walk. We were four couples and had great fun and really enjoyed the stay at the house! Nice people who welcomed us and really easy check-in and check-out. Bella Sicilia!!!</p>
